This project is an Advanced Multiplayer Snake Game built in C using SDL2 for rendering and SDL_net (UDP) for fast, lightweight networking. It features a fully interactive front screen where players can enter their name and choose between playing against the computer or another player; if “Play Against Friend” is selected, the client displays a “Waiting for Other Player” message while sending the player’s name and game mode to the server. The server runs headlessly, storing all player data and managing matchmaking, while all UI and rendering remain on the client side. Once the game begins, the system handles smooth snake movement, collision detection, food spawning, and score tracking, followed by a custom back screen that shows the winner, a leaderboard, and a rematch button. The project is modular, with separate files for the front screen, gameplay logic, networking, rendering, and post-game interface. Through this project, I explored real-time game mechanics, UDP-based communication, client–server design, and structured SDL programming, resulting in a polished and scalable multiplayer game implementation.
